						Discord is required to play on Rattlesnake

						If you do not wish to create or design your own
						character, Rattlesnake Mountain offers a few
						alternatives.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p><strong>I. Randomized Claimable</strong></p>
					<p>
						a. We will randomly choose from a list of our
						current claimable Bachelor Stallions and Herd
						Mares and supply you with three options of each
						gender. You will then choose one horse, and they
						will become your main character.
					</p>
					<p>
						â€¢ In order to choose a horse, please post the form
						found in our #requests-and-updates.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p><strong>II. Adopt a Claimable</strong></p>
					<p>
						a. You may browse through our available horses and
						pick out one that you would like to play! Our
						DeviantArt account houses the most up-to-date
						information on which horses are available for
						claim.
					</p>
					<p>
						b. The horse's personality, history, benefits, and
						detriments are able to be changed at your
						discretion. If you find a horse that you would
						like to adopt, please claim it in
						#requests-and-updates.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p><strong>III. Ask a Rattlesnake Designer</strong></p>
					<p>
						a. You may ask an official Rattlesnake Designer to
						design you a horse or design a rolled genotype
						yourself. An admin will randomly roll you five
						phenotypes, and you will pick one for the designer
						to work with you on creating!
					</p>
					<p>
						b. Please keep in mind, a design may take one-two
						weeks, depending upon complexity and designer
						availability.
					</p>
					<p>
						c. In order to roll your phenotypes, please use
						the Randomized Claimable form in
						#requests-and-updates. A Designer may then be
						found for your chosen genotype in
						#rattlesnake-studio. All designs should be
						submitted in #leader-designs when you are finished
						creating your character.

						You will want to post this response - and all
						future responses - to the Thread created for your
						character on our Discord in #story-progression.
						Failure to post to your created Thread will likely
