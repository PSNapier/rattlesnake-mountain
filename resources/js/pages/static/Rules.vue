					<p><strong>I. Respect</strong></p>
					<p>
						Rattlesnake Mountain and all its players and staff
						abide by the golden rule: "Do to others what you
						want them to do to you.‚Äù This is, above all, the
						most important rule of the group. It isn't hard to
						treat people how you'd like to be treated, and at
						the end of the day, Rattlesnake Mountain is a
						game. We come here to have fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						a. Mature, NSFW, or potentially triggering content
						should be marked accordingly.
					</p>
					<p>
						b. Art theft in any way, shape, or form is not
						tolerated. That said, tracing references from
						stock photos is allowed as long as the piece
						complies with the stock artist's own set of rules.
						Credit does not need to be given unless the stock
						artist requires it.
					</p>
					<p>
						c. Commissions are allowed, however the image must
						be submitted to the appropriate folder in the
						group with the Submission form filled out
						completely. Failure to do so will not result in a
						roll!
					</p>
					<p>
						d. In that same vein, "premade linearts" are also
						permitted as references. They may count for rolls
						as long as literature accompanies the image when
						it is submitted to the group.
					</p>

					<br />
					<p><strong>II. Designs</strong></p>
					<p>
						All designs and characters that were not designed
						or created by you return to their original
						designer(s)/creator(s) upon your departure from
						the Discord.
					</p>
					<p>
						a. All characters will either be released for
						others to claim, use as an NPC, or deceased should
						a player leave the Discord at the discretion of
						the admins.
					</p>
					<p>
						b. This is waived only if they have been purchased
						with an item from the shop or the design/character
						has been under your control actively (one roll per
						month) for at least five in game years.
					</p>

					<br />
					<p><strong>III. Activity</strong></p>
					<p>
						Real life comes first, and we are always willing
						to work with players should they be unable to meet
						our activity requirements! Please don't hesitate
						to reach out!
					</p>
					<p>
						a. Players who miss two activity checks in a row
						(a timeline of ~6 months) with no notice will have
						their Herd Leader listed as Away. Players may
						reinstate their Herd Leader at any time should
						they return to the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						b. Should a Herd Leader be listed as Away, their
						herd NPCs will be released. If the Herd Leader is
						reinstated, their herd may only be reclaimed by
						natural means - either through weekly requested
						encounters; randomized encounters; items; etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						c. Herd members that are released and then claimed
						by other players may not be reclaimed by the
						returning player unless the herd member becomes
						available again.
					</p>

					<br />
					<p><strong>IV. In-Game Time</strong></p>
					<p>
						Time is the master of our universe, and
						Rattlesnake Mountain is no different.
					</p>
					<p>
						a. All characters will officially age one year
						every in-game Spring (~every 4 months) for the
						sake of game continuity. Players may have
						"unofficial" birth dates for their characters.
					</p>
					<p>
						b. For every year aged, a horse earns +1
						Experience.
					</p>

					<br />
					<p><strong>V. Concluding Notes</strong></p>
					<p>
						These rules are subject to change at any time. By
						joining the Rattlesnake Mountain group, you are
						henceforth agreeing to adhere to these rules at
						any given time and location pertaining to
						Rattlesnake Mountain.
					</p>

					<br />
					<p><strong>VI. Disclaimer</strong></p>
					<p>
						Rattlesnake Mountain is intended to be a realistic
						wild horse game that functions similarly to a
						"Choose Your Own Adventure" novel and Dungeons and
						Dragons. As a result, character death and
						possession (herdmates, foals, etc) loss are a very
						real and intended part of the game. If you cannot
						handle the potential for your character to lose
						everything - including their life - then this is
						not the silly art game for you and we fully
						encourage you to find another ARPG that suits your
						preferences.

				<p>
					All responses must be submitted to your character's
					thread in the #story-progression channel. Art and
					Literature submitted on DeviantArt must be submitted to
					the group on DeviantArt in order for it to be
					processed.
				</p>
				<p>
					a. Photo backgrounds must be your intellectual property
					or edited in some way, shape, or form in order for it
					to count toward a roll.
				</p>
				<p>
					b. Artwork and literature may only be used once in the
					group. Recolors and reworks are allowed, but will not
					count toward a roll.
				</p>

					course, permitted, and often required in
					player-vs-player situations!
				</p>
				<p>

					must be at least a headshot.
				</p>
				<p>
					e. All Art and Literature involving your character will
					be linked on your character's DeviantArt upload, along
					with the staff's official stat count. This is in effort
					to consolidate information and make updates to your
					character(s) flow much faster!
				</p>
				<br />
				<p><strong>II. Submissions</strong></p>
				<p>
					Story submissions should be posted in your herd's story
					thread in #herd-stories with the form filled out.
